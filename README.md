This repository holds Neon-specific changes to PostgreSQL
sources. This main branch is a dummy and only contains this
README. The active branches are:

- [REL_17_STABLE_neon](https://github.com/neondatabase/postgres/tree/REL_17_STABLE_neon)
- [REL_16_STABLE_neon](https://github.com/neondatabase/postgres/tree/REL_16_STABLE_neon)
- [REL_15_STABLE_neon](https://github.com/neondatabase/postgres/tree/REL_15_STABLE_neon)
- [REL_14_STABLE_neon](https://github.com/neondatabase/postgres/tree/REL_14_STABLE_neon)

These branches are submodules in the main
[neon](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon) repository under
`vendor/postgres-*`. There's not much point in cloning this repository
independently.

List of the changes compared to upstream PostgreSQL can be found at
https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/main/docs/core_changes.md.
